MojoMagick
==========

MojoMagick is a "dog simple, do very little" image library. It is basically a couple of stateless
module methods that make it somewhat more convenient than calling ImageScience by hand.

The main reason to use MojoMagick is that you should consolidate your ImageScience calls into
one place, so why not do it here? If you improve on this tool, send me the patch.

This tool came about because I wanted a fast, simple, lightweight, nothing-goes-wrong-with-it-
because-it's-too-simple-to-break image tool.

Examples
========

# Obtain the size of an image (assuming image is "120wx222h")
dimensions = MojoMagick::get_image_size(test_image)
 # ==> dimensions now holds a hash: {:height => 120, :width => 222}

# Resize an image so that it fits within a 100w x 200h bounding box
# (Note: this will scale an image either up or down to fit these dimensions
#        which may not be what you want.)
# In this example, we overwrite our image, but if you pass in a different file for the
# second file name, a new file will be created with the resized dimensions
{{{
MojoMagick::resize('/img/test.jpg', '/img/test.jpg', {:width=>100, :height=>200})
}}}

## Full code sample of how to shrink all jpg's in a folder
{{{
require 'mojo_magick'

image_folder = '/tmp/img'
Dir::glob(File::join(image_folder, '*.jpg')).each do |image|
  begin
    # shrink all the images *in place* to no bigger than 60pix x 60pix
    MojoMagick::shrink(image, image, {:width => 60, :height => 60})
    puts "Shrunk: #{image}"
  rescue MojoMagick::MojoFailed => e
    STDERR.puts "Unable to shrink image '#{image}' - probably an invalid image\n#{e.message}"
  rescue MojoMagick::MojoMagickException => e
    STDERR.puts "Unknown exception on image '#{image}'\n#{e.message}"
  end
end
}}}

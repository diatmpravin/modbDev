# The idea behind Group is that it can be a generic group of Anything
# in the system, from Devices to Users to Geofences, etc.
# Every group is to be given the class it is grouping, which goes
# in the 'of' field. Foreign key values of the actual Device/Geofence/whatever
# go in the many-to-many table column "group_links.link_id"
#
# A single Group only covers a single type, you cannot have a Group that
# combines Devices and Geofences, for example. Because of this, the
# many-to-many table can be as simple as possible, as all records with
# this Group's id will link to objects of the 'of' class.
#
# See Device for how to hook up the other side of this.
